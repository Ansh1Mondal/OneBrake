## Problem

- Too much hassle in multi-vehicle journey.
- Repetition of payment to different drivers.
- Wastage of precious time.
- Inconsistent experience.
- Prone to germs ( covid showed us the potent levels of it)

## Solution

- A unified platform for commuter to book all the means of transport from source to destination to reduce time wastage and enable one time payment.
- This platform will connect all the public transport, cabs, rikshaw under one umbrella.
- One time payment method will let commuters pay only one time and that amount then divides and reaches the respective transport

## About
In cities it is quite natural to take more than one vehicles to reach your destination if you don't own one. And it becomes quite a hassle and time taking task to commute through it. You have to pay every single time for what is supposed to be single seamless experience. This causes rush between commuters, resulting in excess traffic.
There isn't any unified platform that connects public transport to each other and with auto-rikshaws to ensure a hassle-free ride from source to destination. This idea/project aims to connect all the buses, rikshaw, metro, etc and make payment a one time task and to reduce time wastage.
