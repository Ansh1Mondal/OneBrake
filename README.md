## Problem

- Too much hassle in multi-vehicle journey.
- Repetition of payment to different drivers.
- Wastage of precious time.
- Inconsistent experience.
- Prone to germs ( covid showed us the potent levels of it)

## Solution

- A unified platform for commuter to book all the means of transport from source to destination to reduce time wastage and enable one time payment.
- This platform will connect all the public transport, cabs, rikshaw under one umbrella.
- One time payment method will let commuters pay only one time and that amount then divides and reaches the respective transport
